## What We Are Building

A retro arcade portfolio website for Sandy E. Quintero.  
Stack: **React 19 + Vite 6 + TypeScript**, GSAP (ScrollTrigger), Three.js, WebAudio chiptune engine.  
No Tailwind — all CSS in `src/styles.css`.  
Live at: TBD (Firebase Hosting, pending deploy)

## Section Map (page order top → bottom)

| Section ID | Component | Nav label |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| `#top` | Hero | — |
| `#arcade` | Arcade | `./arcade` |
| `#reception` | About | `./about` |
| `#experience` | Experience | `./resume` |

| `#skills` | Skills | — |
| `#tv` | TVStudio | `./tv` |
| `#mail` | SystemRoom | `./mail` |

## Content Source of Truth

All profile data lives in `src/data.ts`. Agents must NOT hardcode content — read from data.ts and modify there.

## Language Rule

**Everything on the website must be in English.** TV channel synopses currently in Spanish — flag for translation when working in that section.

## Quality Rules (non-negotiable)

1. Zero TypeScript errors (`tsc --noEmit` must pass before any phase is marked complete)
2. No placeholder text — everything is real content or explicitly marked "Coming Soon"
3. Every game and section must be responsive (phone, tablet, desktop)
4. All sounds are synthesized WebAudio — no audio file assets
5. Brutal Critic review required before any game ships (code correctness only)

## Agent Roster

| Agent | Tab | Mission file |
|-------|-----|-------------|

| Agent: Arcade + Games | Tab 1 | `.agents/agent-arcade.md` (TBD) |
